### Description
In this project followings gave been done:
- Create and incorporate multiple classes, both abstract and concrete, that use inheritance to simplify the design of an application

### Background
Your consulting company has been requested to develop an application for a small banking-like business. The business manages two different kinds of accounts: A Checking account, and a Savings Account.
- Checking Account: a checking account will allow for an overdraft, up to specified value. The maximum overdraft value can be set on a per account basis. Monthly interest will only be added to a checking account only if there was no overdraft in the previous month (since the last time monthly interest was added to the account).
- Savings Account: a savings account will specify a minimum balance that must be maintained for monthly interest rate to be added. If the balance falls below the minimum balance at any time in the previous month (since the last time monthly interest was added to the account) monthly interest will not be accrued.
